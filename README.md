### Research

**Feasibility Study of ARIMA Model for PM2.5 Prediction using Real-world Data Gathered from Pune Region**  
This paper investigates the feasibility of using the ARIMA time-series model to predict PM2.5 concentrations in Pune, India, based on real-world sensor data. The study highlights both the potential and limitations of univariate forecasting, showing that while ARIMA captures trends, external environmental and human factors significantly influence accuracy. This work laid the foundation for my later **Air Quality Forecasting & Visualization project**, where I extended the approach to include interactive dashboards, additional datasets, and more scalable machine learning methods.
